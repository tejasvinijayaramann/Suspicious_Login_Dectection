Project: Suspicious Login Detection
File: Digital_Investigation_Task.pcapng
Tools Used: Wireshark

Filter Applied: TCP traffic (loopback 127.0.0.1)
Observations:
- All packets are TCP between 127.0.0.1 (local traffic)
- Viewed raw data in TCP stream (hex and ASCII)
- No login credentials or external IPs detected
- Practiced using Wireshark filters and stream reconstruction

Next Steps:
- Capture traffic from a real login page or FTP simulation
- Apply filters like http.request.method == "POST" or ftp.request.command == "USER"
